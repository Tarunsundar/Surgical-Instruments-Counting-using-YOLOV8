# 🩺 Surgical Instrument Counter  

This project is a **real-time object detection and counting system** designed to identify and count medical instruments using a webcam.  
It uses **YOLOv8** for detection and **Supervision** + OpenCV for visualization.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects and counts medical instruments from **live webcam feed** or video.
- Displays **bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores**.
- Shows **per-class counts** and **total instrument count** in real-time.
- Can be adapted for **custom-trained datasets** (Roboflow/YOLO format).
- Works with low-cost webcams for **proof-of-concept demos**.
